<h2>Certificate of Informed Consent</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study about the structure of language and speakers' knowledge of that structure.</p>

<h3>Why is this study being done?</h3>
<p>This study is being conducted to better understand the human language faculty, and what it means to know a language.</p>

<h3>What are the study procedures? What will I be asked to do?</h3>
<p>If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to read sentences and then rate their acceptability. The number of sentences you will be asked to read, and the time it will take to read them all, is listed in the advertisement for the experiment. It is typically less than 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>What other options are there?</h3>
<p>Participation in this study is voluntary. There is no cost to you for participating. You may refuse to participate or discontinue your involvement at any time without penalty. You may choose to skip any question about your personal information or any study procedure. However, there are no options other than not participating in the study.</p>

<h3>What are the risks or inconveniences of the study?</h3>
<p>We believe there are no known risks associated with this research study aside those of everyday life; however, a possible inconvenience may be the time it takes to complete the study.</p>

<h3>What are the benefits of the study?</h3>
<p>There are no direct benefits to you for participation in this study. However, this study will increase our knowledge of the human language faculty, and may one day aid in the development of treatments for language disorders.</p>

<h3>Will I receive payment for participation? Are there costs to participate?</h3>
<p>There is no cost to you for participation. You will be compensated at the rate of $10 per hour for participating in this research, based on our estimates of the amount of time each survey requires. For example, if we estimate the time required to complete a survey at 30 minutes, you will be paid $5.</p>

<h3>How will my personal information be protected?</h3>
<p>All research data collected will be stored securely and confidentially on a password protected server indefinitely. Your Amazon Mechanical Turk Worker ID will be collected, but it will not be associated with the data provided by you. Amazon Mechanical Turk Worker IDs will only be stored in a list format in order to record who has participated in each survey, so that no one participates in the same survey twice. The list will be destroyed when the study is completed. There is no way to link the data you provided back to you. The research data may be shared, but without any kind of identifying information about you.</p>

<p>You should also know that the University of Connecticut, Storrs or New York University Abu Dhabi Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and associated Research Compliance Services may inspect study records as part of their auditing program, but these reviews will only focus on the researchers and not on your responses or involvement. The IRB is a group of people who review research studies to protect the rights and welfare of research participants.</p>

<h3>Can I stop being in the study and what are my rights?</h3>

<p>You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to. If you agree to be in the study, but later change your mind, you may drop out at any time. There are no penalties or consequences of any kind if you decide that you do not want to participate.</p>
<h3>Whom do I contact if I have questions about the study?</h3>
