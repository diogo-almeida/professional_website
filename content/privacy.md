I am not an expert in web technologies, and therefore all the information below is provided on a "best of my knowledge" basis. However, the information below does reflect my intentions and aspirations for how this site should handle private information. If you happen to know any factual mistakes in the following, please do get in touch so I can rectify this policy.

## Who is responsible for this site and how to get in touch with them?

The person responsible for this website is me, Diogo Almeida. You can find my contact information in the "contact" section of my homepage.

## Collection of your personal information

Nothing on this website requires you to identify yourself.

This website is created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a _static_ site generator. This means that the whole site is generated in a single step on my computer, with the resulting _static webpages_ (HTML files) simply being copied to an internet server, which you can then browse from your computer. There is no _dynamic_, server-generated content that relies or responds to your personal information or your user-input powering this website.

The website is hosted by Netlify. They create access logs for this homepage and store your IP address for not more than 30 days.

The website is served to your computer via _https_, a secure (encrypted) html-file-serving protocol.

However, this site does make use of certain third-party services that may collect data from you. They are

* Google Analytics
* Google Webfonts

### Google Analytics

I use GoogleAnalytics on this site to better understand how the site is being used. The GoogleAnalytics service allows for the collection of personal data, such as your IP address, _but this option has been disabled for this website_: when you visit this site, your IP is immediately anonymized before being sent to GoogleAnalytics. This means that the only information collected while you visit this site is non-identifying, such as browser type and operating system. I do not collect this information and have no access to it other than as aggregated reports provided to me by GoogleAnalytics. However, you can still opt out from being tracked by GoogleAnalytics on this website by [clicking here](javascript:gaOptout()).

If you have not opted out from being tracked on this website, GoogleAnalytics collects information from you via cookies. Most web browsers allow you to control the handling of cookies. To the best of my knowledge, you can disable all cookies for this website without in any way reducing the functionality for you.

In order to better understand how GoogleAnalytics may collect your personal information in general, please visit their [privacy page](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

### Google Fonts

This website uses the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) service. This means that when you access this site, your browser may make a request to a Google server in order to obtain the fonts used on this website _in case they are not already saved on your browsers' cache_. If the fonts are already saved on your browser's cache, no request is sent to Google Fonts. To the best of my knowledge, the request from your browser to the Google Fonts service does not send along any personal information. You can find more information at [Google Fonts & Privacy](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#what_does_using_the_google_fonts_api_mean_for_the_privacy_of_my_users).

## Sharing of your personal information

Because I do not collect any personal information from you, there is nothing for me to share.

Provided you have not opted out from being tracked by Google Analytics, this service does collect some information about you, which may be shared with third parties.

Note: As mentioned above, however, I have configured the GoogleAnalytics service to only track non-identifying information for this website. For a more complete exposition, see the [Google Analytics privacy page](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

## Use of your personal information

For each visitor to reach the site, Google Analytics collects the following non-personally identifiable information, including but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the site, page access times and referring website address. This information is presented to me as aggregated reports for the purpose of gauging visitor traffic and trends.

## Your rights

Under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the following rights:

This means that you have the right to request that I turn over to you all personal information collected in this website about you, so you can either correct it or delete it. However, as mentioned above, _I do not collect any personal information from you_ in this website.
