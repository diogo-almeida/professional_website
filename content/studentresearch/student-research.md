## NYUAD student looking for a Capstone Project Advisor

If you are a Psychology or a Biology student taking the Capstone Seminar right now and you may be interested in doing your NYUAD Capstone Project with me, please send me a message and we can schedule a meeting to discuss potential project ideas.

In case you are not yet taking the Capstone Seminar, you should contact me about other potential research opportunities in the lab (see below).


## NYUAD student looking to volunteer in the lab

In case you are looking for research opportunities in the lab as a way to gain research experience, please send me a message and we can arrange a meeting and discuss this.

However, as a general rule, I tend to only accept research volunteers who can make a minimal time commitment (at least 3 hours/week) for the duration of one semester. You should also be wiling to learn some basic computer programing skills.

In case you are not in a position to make that time commitment, I will probably just tell you to attend our lab meetings a few times to get a sense of the kind of research we do in the lab before we discuss any concrete projects.

## NYUAD student looking for summer research opportunities in the lab

In case you are looking for summer research opportunities or internships, please send me a message to discuss this. Please note that research opportunities over the summer tend to be rare and quite limited.

## Non-NYUAD student looking for research opportunities in the lab

For general inquiries about research opportunities in the lab for non-NYUAD students, please contact me by email.
