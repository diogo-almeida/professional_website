  abstract={Branigan and Pickering advocate the use of syntactic priming to investigate linguistic representations and argue it overcomes several purported deficiencies of acceptability judgments. While we recognize the merit of drawing attention to a potentially underexplored experimental methodology in language science, we do not believe the empirical evidence supports Branigan and Pickeringâ€™s claims about acceptability judgments. We present the relevant evidence.}
