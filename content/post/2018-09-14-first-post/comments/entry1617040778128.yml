comment: "The pattern measure I truism Gail Dines converse, at a conference in Boston, she moved the audience to tears with her statement of the problems caused by porn, and provoked laughing with her sharp observations near pornographers themselves. Activists in the audience were newly inspired, and men at the event – sundry of whom had on no account viewed obscenity as a disturbed first – queued up afterwards to pledge their support. The scene highlighted Dines's unsound charisma and the factually that, since the dying of Andrea Dworkin, she has risen to that most sensitive and interesting of conspicuous roles: the world's leading anti-pornography campaigner. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://lesbian-tube.tv>lesbian-tube</a>"
