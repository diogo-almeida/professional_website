Hello there!

This is my first post in this new website. Over the years I've tried to maintain a web presence, but I was never really satisfied with the options that were available to me. When I found out about the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) [R](https://www.r-project.org) package, everything seemed to click: I am an avid [R](https://www.r-project.org) user and I really like the idea of a static website that allows me to simplify my workflow and lower the time investment needed to maintain a proper website+blog AND allows me to write blog posts in [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), making it easier to share and communicate ideas about statistics, data visualization and data analysis.

So I have finally put a proper webpage together, and I hope to do some light blogging about my work in cognitive neuroscience, linguistics and statistics. And plenty of [R](https://www.r-project.org) code as well. I hope to slowly build up this site to include simple services like comments and forms, to allow some interaction with visitors.

Let's see where this new experiment leads me!
