Central to language comprehension is how the long-term memory representations of linguistic information guide or otherwise impinge on perception. I have previously approached this in the domain of vision and sign language (Almeida, Poeppel & Corina, 2016), but my current focus is in speech perception (Schluter, Politzer-Ahles & Almeida, 2016; Schluter, Politzer-Ahles, Al Kaabi & Almeida, 2017; Politzer-Ahles, Schluter, Wu & Almeida, 2016). In particular, I am interested in the extent to which the representations of speech sounds in long-term memory is tied to sensory processing: do speech sound categories in long-term memory retain fine-grained acoustic/phonetic information or are they fairly abstract and/or optimally sparse?

Research from my lab on this topic has exploited an automatic difference-detection brain response in the auditory domain (the Mismatch Negativity - MMN), and the results have consistently pointed to long-term memory representations for speech sounds that are fairly abstract when it comes to sensory information, and also potentially sparse in their featural content.
