 *  Font faces
 *
 *  The best sans serif for the fonts I like seems
 *  to be News Cycle, which is FREE!! (it's virtually identical to BarnaulGrotesk!)
 *  Both BarnaulGrotesk and Tangent (and Tangent Nar) are the best non-free options. Fira Sans does a good job for Margon, Adonis, Scientia and some others
 *  A good, but squarer approxiation is Titillium Web.
 *  Rosario, Fontin Sans and Gafata are almost a perfect match to
 *     - Scientia (Average Sans)
 *     - Octava (Oswald is surprisingly ok)
 *     - Aelita (Eau Naturelle, Source Sans Pro, Fira Sans, Fontin Sans)
 *     - Orbi
 *     - Adonis (especially Fontin Sans, Lato is ok, Cabin is ok, Assistant, Belleza, Shanti, Galdeano)
 *     - Margon
 *  News Cycle provides a good fit to the following
 *  custom fonts for which I do have webfont licenses
 *     - Octava (Average Sans)
 *     - Aelita
 *     - Scientia
 *     - Deca Serif New
 *     - Margon (380 or 400 seems best) (Fontin Sans, Belleza)
 *     - Adonis
 *  It also provides a good fit to the following google fonts
 *     - Nanum Myeongjo (one of the best fits amongst all)
 *     - PT Serif (texture is a tad too thick for my taste, but it works well)
 *     - Source Serif Pro (about the same as PT Serif)
 *     - Tinos (works well, but the texture is thicker than I would have liked)
 *     - Manuale (works really well)
 *     - Faustina (works really well, texture is just shy of too thick)
 *     - Halant (works well; texture is ok, but may look a little too bland)
 *     - Lora (works well, but the typeface is a little too retro imho)
 *     - Maitree (works well, abou the same as Lora)
 *     - Noticia Text (works well, but almost a bit too large)
 *     - Martel (works well, but even a wee bit larger than Noticia Text)
 *     - Vesper Libre (works ok, texture is just a bit too thick)
 *     - Frank Ruhl Libre (works ok, texture is a bit too thick)
 *     - David Libre (works ok, but there is a bit of visual clash imho)
 *     - Noto Serif (texture is too thick)
 *     - IBM Plex Serif (ok, but looks a bit too thick and big)
 *     - Laila (same proportions but funky shapes. May work better as display.)
