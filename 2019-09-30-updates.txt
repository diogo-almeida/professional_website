==================

Trying to get my website up and running again

Problem:

- It appears that my local personal_website folder is not in sync with my github repo
- Maybe this happens when my computer died last year, and I haven't been able to re-set it up since.

What should I do?

- I guess I can just clone my github repo, reset the permissions and restart my work

major issue:

- I did not document my previous work properly. It's gonna be a pain to re-do everything.


Steps to retrieve the up-to-date repo from GitHub (Sep 30, 2019)
================================================================

1) Rename local folder out of sync.

Personal_Website -> Personal_Website_OLD

This worked by just renaming the folder and .Rproj file

2) Cloning the github repo

git clone https://github.com/diogo-almeida/professional_website.git professional_website

3) That worked!! The Rproj file is there too. And if I click on it, it works normally in RStudio.

4) Now I need to set the upload permissions!!!

git remote -v

This works. My GH repo is already set up as the fetch/pull one.

Now I need to configure the push permissions.

Attempt 1: update teaching.md to reflect my sabbatical year and try to push it online.
(seems to have stalled) ---> ACTUALLY, it did go through. But how? OH, I see, I cloned it from my own github page. I am the only person who has access to that. Otherwise, it would have asked me to clone it.

From what I understand, since I cloned using https, the push is also done in https, which requires password authentication. When I pushed the file, it did not ask for it, but maybe it is because git can remember a password for a few minutes, so we don't have to insert a password for every push?

See this to explain the differences in protocols:

And more generally:

https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
https://github.com/settings/keys

Ok, so I guess this means I have a working version of my website on my local folder again.

Now I can start working on updating the infrastructure to Academic 4.5

NOTE 1: this will require setting up Netlify as well, as it will require a new version of Hugo.

NOTE 2: I am sort of a dumbass, as I HAD a local copy properly synced to GH. It was on Google Drive/Website not in Google Drive/RCode/personal_website!!

GOALS
=====

- Update the whole infrastructure to Academic 4.5
- In particular:
    1. Using staticman to handle comments
    2. Using reCaptcha to handle spam in comments

Adapting Academic 4.5 to handle staticman comments
--------------------------------------------------

1. Basic infrastructure in configuration files

2. Changing the layout partials to handle comments

UPDATE ON OCTOBER 1st:

- I've made a number of changes on the hugo infrastructure that work with the new page bundle organization. Basically, all the composing parts of a post (images, docs, etc) can now be stored under the same folder and looked up and referred to quite easily with the new resources look up.

- With this organization, it would make sense if the comments were also inside the post bundle.

- I've made it work from the perspective of the directory structure: Comments added to a /comments subfolder are correctly read and counted into their containing page. Adding new comments should be a matter of automatically dropping a new file in the relevant /comments subfolder.

- Unfortunately, the bottleneck here is Staticman, which requires a single static folder as a path. Thus, it seems that I cannot dynamically pass the page bundle folder of the post being commented on to Staticman, which makes my solution pointless

- I've found an updated version of a hugo blog that uses staticman AND page bundles, but comments and posts are kept separate. At least the framework seems to work: https://github.com/dancwilliams/networkhobo. Now all I need to do is adapt what they do there to my directory infrastructure. So much work just for comments!

UPDATE ON OCTOBER 2nd:

- Will start adapting the infrastructure that works (https://github.com/dancwilliams/networkhobo) for academic. Let's see how this works.

- Remember (https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/front-matter/):
RMarkdown should be saved with the .Rmarkdown file extension rather than the .Rmd extension.

1. add permalinks option in config.toml (has to be there and not in params for blogdown!) - apparently it's better for page bundles too

[permalinks]
  post = "/:title/"

2.
