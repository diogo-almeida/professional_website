Trying to get my website up and running again

Problem 1:

- It appears that my local personal_website folder is not in sync with my github repo
- Maybe this happens when my computer died last year, and I haven't been able to re-set it up since.

What should I do?

- I guess I can just clone my github repo, reset the permissions and restart my work

major issue:

- I did not document my previous work properly. It's gonna be a pain to re-do everything.


Steps to retrieve the up-to-date repo from GitHub (Sep 30, 2019)
================================================================

1) Rename local folder out of sync.

Personal_Website -> Personal_Website_OLD

This worked by just renaming the folder and .Rproj file

2) Cloning the github repo

git clone https://github.com/diogo-almeida/professional_website.git professional_website

3) That worked!! The Rproj file is there too. And if I click on it, it works normally in RStudio.

4) Now I need to set the upload permissions!!!

git remote -v

This works. My GH repo is already set up as the fetch/pull one.

Now I need to configure the push permissions.

Attempt 1: update teaching.md to reflect my sabbatical year and try to push it online.
(seems to have stalled) ---> ACTUALLY, it did go through. But how? OH, I see, I cloned it from my own github page. I am the only person who has access to that. Otherwise, it would have asked me to clone it.

From what I understand, since I cloned using https, the push is also done in https, which requires password authentication. When I pushed the file, it did not ask for it, but maybe it is because git can remember a password for a few minutes, so we don't have to insert a password for every push?

See this to explain the differences in protocols:

And more generally:
https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html
https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
https://github.com/settings/keys

Ok, so I guess this means I have a working version of my website on my local folder again.

Now I can start working on updating the infrastructure to Academic 4.5

NOTE: this will require setting up Netlify as well, as it will require a new version of Hugo.
